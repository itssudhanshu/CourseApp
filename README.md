# My Tech stack and tools

In this repository you can find a list of tools, programming language and frameworks that I would use to build any kind of project.

Some of the tools listed I'm gaining experience like Flutter, Firebase etc through reading blogs and tutorials that made me think it would be a great choice for some type of project like this App.
